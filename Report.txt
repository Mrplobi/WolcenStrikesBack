Ligue bois 2:

Access to distance and angle to next Checkpoint.
The aim here is to prevent overshooting the checkpoints and to correct trajectory quickly.
The pod accelerates less when it is inside a checkpoint (making it go lose speed faster if it had some) to reduce overshoot. 
Moreover, the thrust is greatly reduced when not facing towards the next checkpoint to facilitate quick turns.

The values were found throught trial and error.

Time taken : about 30 min 

Note : Tried to beat everyone but one guy just wouldn't let me win...
